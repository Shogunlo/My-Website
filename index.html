            <h2>Introduction to Kovaaks Aim Training</h2>
            <p>Kovaaks aim trainer designed to improve your aiming mechanics. This guide will walk you through the
                fundamental task types and playlists to achieve better results.</p>
            <p>The playlists types I'll cover can be broken down into categories each focused on a different style of mechanical skill. I'll include some major categories on this page below</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Smooth Tracking</li>
                <li>Reactive Tracking</li>
                <li>Speed Tracking</li>
                <li>Evasive Tracking</li>
                <li>Dynamic Clicking</li>
                <li>Static Clicking</li>

            <h2>Getting Started with Kovaaks Aim Training</h2>
            <p>To begin your Kovaaks journey, lets start finding a comfortable mouse sensitivity for you. The goal is
                being comfortable performing a 180-degree turn in a single motion.</p>

                <!-- Not loving the verbiage here and likely will include a different section entirely later -->
            <p>The easiest way to get started is to make sure you have a good mouse dpi setting. Ideally you should be
                between 400 to 1600 dpi as anything higher will be hard to control but on top of that most games have a
                limited range of sensitivity control so you might be unable to adjust the sensitivity to your ideal
                range in your game of choice.</p>
